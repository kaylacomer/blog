      <p>Last week, I worked on comparing the testbench results to AFF3CT&rsquo;s simulation and adding new codecs into the OOT module.</p>
<p>I implemented the polar codec with hard-coded values to get it up and running. Now, I need to go back and adjust the code so a user can configure the simulation to their preferences. I also started adding the turbo product code (TPC) codec but encountered errors along the way and have more work to do with it.</p>
<p>I created a plot_testbench tool to plot the data recorded by the testbench. Currently, it only plots the testbench&rsquo;s data and not AFF3CT&rsquo;s simulation data. I plan to restructure the testbench&rsquo;s created data file to match AFF3CT&rsquo;s format. That way, users can upload their data to AFF3CT&rsquo;s BER/FER comparator tool on its website and use its PyBER Python GUI tool. Users can use my plotting tool for convenience and AFF3CT&rsquo;s plotting tools if they want to view the data in more detail.</p>
<p>I revisited the BCH code implementation, which had been unexpectedly and inconsistently returning segmentation faults. I made some progress on the codec, but ultimately, I am still experiencing issues with the codec.</p>
<p>This week, my main focuses are to generate plots from the codecs I have working, and update incomplete but functional implementations to allow more user configurations.</p>
