      <p>At the end of the first two weeks, I am unfortunately behind schedule. Setting up the development environment so that I can work in-tree has required troubleshooting every step of the way. Based on my issues, I plan to update the MacOS installation guide on the wiki in the next few weeks, or at least point out some outdated instructions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to start working on new blocks in an OOT module called fec_dev before moving my code over to the main tree. This allows me to use gr_modtool to create new blocks but introduced some challenges with linking to the FEC source code. Generally, gr-fec implements different coding schemes by using a variable block to modify generic encoder and decoder blocks. This variable includes the main work functions.</p>
<p>My first week goal was to create the Turbo Parallel codec blocks, and my second week goal was to code 3 more. I have created Turbo encoder and decoder blocks based on gr-fec&rsquo;s Dummy codec. It does not do any processing and directly passes the input bits to the output.</p>
<p>My next step is to build the Turbo encoder and decoder blocks from the AFF3CT source code. I am still working on linking AFF3CT into my project and will then need to incorporate AFF3CT&rsquo;s Turbo code into the encoder and decoder blocks. Turbo Parallel also relies on a Puncturer, which I will need to add as a new block. gr-fec has a Puncture block, but I&rsquo;m not yet sure how I&rsquo;ll need to modify it for Turbo.</p>
<p>Though I am already behind, I know that implementing the Turbo Parallel codec will be the biggest hurdle. From there, it will be easier to add in additional blocks.</p>
